### 1.2 Features

ATK-MD0700 V3 module is a high-performance 7.0 inch TFTLCD capacitive touch screen module launched by ALIENTEK. The module has two LCD resolutions of **800 * 480** and **1024 * 600**, and supports up to 24 bit true color display. LT7381 as the LCD driver chip, the chip with its own RAM, without external driver or memory, so most of thev several external master controllers can easily drive the module. At the same time, the ATK-MD0700 V3 module also supports touch and uses capacitors touch screen, support 5 points touch at the same time, has a very good control effect.
